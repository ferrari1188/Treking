  <h1><strong>Plan The Perfect Route</strong></h1>
    <p>If you would rather plan your own adventure,
    trek makes that easier, too. Whether you want smooth asphalt for your road bike,
    single tracks for your mountain bike or peaceful trails for your hikes, Trek
    generates sport-specific, topographic routing—tailor-made for your next outdoor
    experience. Simply customize each route to include whatever you want to see along
    the way, and view inch-by-inch surface and way type readings to ensure you always
    know what’s coming—wherever your adventure takes you.</p>
